This project contains extensions to Facebooker that enhances its use for
Desktop sessions.  For example, if you want to log into facebook without
using a GUI browser you can simply do the following:

mysession = Facebooker::Session::Desktop.create( api_key, secret_key )
mysession.do_login

You will be prompted for a login and password and then the do_login method
uses mechanize to fill out the form and process the login for you.
